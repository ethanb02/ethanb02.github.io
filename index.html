    <h1>Ethan's Programming Portfolio</h1> 
    <p>This website will a place where I can show my work to those interested. With being new at coding, I will not have much to present right away, but as time goes on I will add to the list.<br>
    The website will include a number of custom assets that will make it uniquely mine. I have a bit of experience in Photoshop, so making these will probably be easier than the actual coding that goes behind making this site.</p>
