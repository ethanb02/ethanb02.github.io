      <h1>About me</h1>
       <p>I am a sophomore undergraduate student at the University of Rhode Island. I am majoring in film, but right now I am focused on trying to get into the broadcasting industry. 
          I am from Cumberland, RI, and I live with my parents and two siblings. I enjoy mindfulness practices, being with my cat, and sometimes scale model building. 
          My goal is to leave college with a decently ballanced set of skills with connections made that will hopefully launch my career off well.
